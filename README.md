# hello-world
Aaron is learning github and this is his first repository for data. Kudos to him.
On behalf of Aaron, we would like to thank you for introducing us to GitHub. Aaron is 180lbs of twisted steel and sex appeal. He's traveled extensively and "seen some shit in his day". He aspires to work with his old war buddies in some capacity doing nation building and community development throughout the Pacific.
